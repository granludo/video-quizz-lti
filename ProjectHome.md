Video has become an important chanel to deliver educational contents.
MOOCS, ONline Learning, Blended Learning and flipped classroom stretagies rely heavily on using video lectures and learning materials.
Video-Quizz-4-LTI implements a IMS LTI compatible Module - so it can be used in almost any LMS - that enables an HTML5  video player that embeds in specific points of reproduction. This quizzes can be used for self assesment, grading purposes, sending feedback and proving to the teacher that the video has been viewed and paid atention to it.
Charles Severance's (drchuck) framework tsugi will be used as a platform for its development.
